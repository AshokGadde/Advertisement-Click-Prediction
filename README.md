# Advertisement-Click-Prediction
Explore the intricacies of user behavior with the "Ad Click Prediction" model, designed to foresee whether an internet user is likely to click on an advertisement. The dataset encompasses key user attributes, including daily time spent on the site, age, area income, and daily internet usage. Utilizing Python and Scikit-Learn, I delved into comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering to unravel meaningful insights. The project goes beyond revealing influential factors in ad clicks, presenting a robust predictive model. To delve deeper, check out the following files:
